# ðŸŒ¾ p5.grain
p5.grain is a [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) addon for conveniently adding grain and texture overlays to artworks.

p5.grain was also created with [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz) projects in mind that use the deterministic `fxrand` random function.

You can read more in detail about the different techniques to achieve grain in artworks in the article "[All about that grain](https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain)" by [Gorilla Sun](https://twitter.com/gorillasu) and [meezwhite](https://twitter.com/meezwhite).

## Getting started
Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/meezwhite/p5.grain/releases) and embed `p5.grain.min.js` (~9.5 KB) or `p5.grain.core.js` (~3.5 KB) in your project's HTML file *after* loading p5.js but *before* loading your sketch code.

```html
<script src="./lib/p5.min.js"></script>
<!-- insert after p5.js -->
<script src="./lib/p5.grain.min.js"></script>
<script src="./sketch.js"></script>
```

*Note: The minified version `p5.grain.min.js` is primarily meant for development, since it handles errors and warnings. However, we recommend using the even smaller core version `p5.grain.core.js` when your sketch is final and you've made sure that p5.grain-related errors and warnings cannot occur.*

## Usage

The first step is to set up p5.grain according to your project's needs in the `setup` function of your sketch.

### Non-deterministic setup

Suited for projects that *don't* have to be deterministic, *don't* use the [pixel manipulation](#pixel-manipulation) technique, or *don't* use methods for animating texture overlays.

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {
    p5grain.setup();
}
```

### Deterministic setup

Suited for projects that should be deterministic.

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {
    // make Math.random be same as random
    Math.random = random;

    // set seeds (example)
    randomSeed(999999);
    noiseSeed(999999);

    p5grain.setup();
}
```

### Deterministic setup (fxhash)

Suited for fxhash projects.

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {
    // make Math.random be same as fxrand
    Math.random = fxrand;

    // set seeds (example)
    randomSeed(fxrand() * 999999);
    noiseSeed(fxrand() * 999999);

    // use fxrand as the internal random function
    p5grain.setup({ random: fxrand });
}
```

### Ignoring errors and warnings

*Note: Ignoring errors and warnings is not possible when using `p5.grain.core.js`, since errors and warnings are not handled in the core version of p5.grain.*

Initially, p5.grain will attempt to extend p5 core functionality by registering new methods. If a method cannot be registered because the method name is already in use, p5.grain will log a warning with a suggestion of an alternative usage. You can prevent warnings to be logged by passing `ignoreWarnings: true` to the `config` object when setting up p5.grain.

When using p5.grain methods, the library validates the parameters passed to the respective methods, and error messages are thrown in case of invalid parameters to attract attention during development. You can prevent errors to be thrown by passing `ignoreErrors: true` to the `config` object when setting up p5.grain. 

*Note: If your sketch is final and you've made sure that p5.grain-related errors or warnings cannot occur, we recommend using `p5.grain.core.js` instead of manually ignoring errors and warnings as shown below, since errors and warnings are not handled in the core version of p5.grain.*

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {
    // ignore warnings and errors
    p5grain.setup({
        ignoreWarnings: true,
        ignoreErrors: true,
    });
}
```

## Techniques

p5.grain currently supports the techniques: pixel manipulation, texture overlay and SVG filter. WebGL shader technique is coming soon.

Depending on how your artwork is created and whether you want to animate texture overlays, you would use p5.grain methods within the `setup` or `draw` functions of your sketch.

The best way to get you started with a technique is to check out the provided standalone [examples](./examples). There is an example for each technique currently supported by the library.

Go to standalone example:
* [Pixel manipulation](./examples/pixel-manipulation)
* Texture overlay
  * [Inside canvas](./examples/texture-overlay-inside) (texture animation supported)
  * [Outside canvas](./examples/texture-overlay-outside) (texture animation supported)
* SVG filter
  * [SVG element](./examples/svg-element) (texture animation supported; [limited compatibility in Safari](#limitations))
  * [SVG URL-encoded](./examples/svg-url-encoded) (texture animation supported; [doesn't work in Safari](#limitations))
* Shader (soon)

Here are a few examples of a basic implementation for each respective technique. *Note: the examples below are non-deterministic.*

### Pixel manipulation

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {

    p5grain.setup();

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    // example: simple method
    p5grain.granulateSimple(42);

    // example: channels method
    // p5grain.granulateChannels(42);
}
```

The next example demonstates granulating the artwork using `tinkerPixels(callback, shouldUpdate)` pixel-manipulation function. In this case the `callback` function is an implementation of the `granulateSimple` function. *Note that the example is non-deterministic!*

```js
function setup() {

    p5grain.setup();

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    // example: custom granulateSimple implementation
    const amount = 42;
    const alpha = false;
    p5grain.tinkerPixels((index, total) => {
        const grainAmount = Math.floor(random() * (amount * 2 + 1)) - amount;
        pixels[index] = pixels[index] + grainAmount;
        pixels[index+1] = pixels[index+1] + grainAmount;
        pixels[index+2] = pixels[index+2] + grainAmount;
        if (alpha) {
            pixels[index+3] = pixels[index+3] + grainAmount;
        }
    });
}
```

#### Read-only mode
If you would simply like to loop through the pixels and read their values without manipulating them, you can set `shouldUpdate` to `false`. This will internally skip `updatePixels()`:
```js
let minAvg = 255;
let maxAvg = 0;
p5grain.tinkerPixels((index, total) => {
    // determine min, max average pixel values
    const avg = round((pixels[index] + pixels[index+1] + pixels[index+2])/3);
    minAvg = min(minAvg, avg);
    maxAvg = max(maxAvg, avg);
}, false); // <-- shouldUpdate = false
```

### Texture overlay inside canvas

```js
let textureImage;

function preload() {
    textureImage = loadImage('./assets/texture.jpg');
}

function setup() {

    p5grain.setup();

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    p5grain.textureOverlay(textureImage);
}
```

### Texture overlay inside canvas with texture animation

```js
let textureImage;

function preload() {
    textureImage = loadImage('./assets/texture.jpg');
}

function setup() {
    p5grain.setup();
}

function draw() {

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    p5grain.textureOverlay(textureImage, { animate: true });
}
```

## Global mode vs Instance mode

`p5.grain` now supports both global mode and instance mode for p5.js. In either case, you will need to create and manage the instance of P5Grain yourself.

In global mode, you can simply create an instance and refer to it where used:

```js
let p5grain = new P5Grain();
function setup() {

    p5grain.setup();

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    // example: simple method
    p5grain.granulateSimple(42);
}
```

In instance mode, you can refer to the instance you create _or_ the instance that is saved to the sketch. For example:

```js
sketch.setup = () => {

    new P5Grain().setup({
        random: sketch.random,
        instanceMode: true,
        instanceRef: sketch,
     });

    // draw your artwork here
    // ...

    // example: simple method
    sketch.p5grain.granulateSimple(42);
}
```

| Please note that you will need to pass in `sketch.random` as the random function as well.

## Limitations

* Safari: SVG element technique only works for browser window resolutions with less than 2<sup>20</sup> pixels (e.g. 1024 x 1024 pixels).
* Safari: SVG URL-encoded technique is currently unsupported.
